# Design-Realization-2024
ESP32 Sensor Data Processing and Transmission This project uses an ESP32 to collect sensor data and send it to an ESP8266 receiver via ESP-NOW or a logistic regression ML model for data cleaning with Google Sheets. Designed for a flex sensor, but compatible with any Arduino-based sensor.
